# spotify-token
A simple server for serving the access token from Spotify. It is used primarily by [this app](https://ksmai.github.io/spotify-clone/) after Spotify started to require authentication from 29 May 2017. See [Spotify web api](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#client-credentials-flow) for details.
